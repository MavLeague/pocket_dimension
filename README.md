# Pocket Dimensions
This project introduces a fascinating item to the game. It's similar to a bundle, but with a room inside. You can build whatever you want inside and take it with you!

## How to use it

After creating the item, right-click to activate and enter it. There is only one room per player. So, if you craft another one, it will take you to the same room. You can identify the room by the player name in the description. Any player with that item can join the room that the item is bound to.

Once you have activated your room, you can place it in the Overworld. Don't worry — if someone tries to destroy it while you're inside, you'll feel it. However, other players can also enter it as long as it is placed. If it gets destroyed, everyone inside will leave the pocket instantly.
